    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <p>Welcome everyone, my name is Andrew Haines! I am a student at Illinois Institute of Technology</p>
    <p>This is a website that I created for my ITM web development class.  If you are interested, there are two other pages you can travel too within this website.  Click on the links at the top of the page to see what happens!</p>
	<h1>About me:</h1>
	<img src= "media/pictureofme.media" alt = "Me">
	<p>As you can see, this is an image of my goofy face.  I want to take the time and introduce myself to you.  I find it is best to always start off an introduction with some background information.  I live in Chicago land area.  Originally, I am from St.Joseph, Michigan.  I grew up in St. Joseph and graduated high school at the St. Joseph High School.  If you are looking at Michigan on the map, St. Joseph is located at the left-bottom corner of the glove.</p>
	<img src= "media/pictureofsj.media" alt = "St Joseph">
	<p>The picture above is a picture of the best spot in the city of St. Joseph.... the beach!</p>
	<P>Ater I graduated highschool in 2015, I moved to Glen Ellyn so that I could attend College of Dupage.</p>
	<p>At College of DuPage, I pursued an associate's degree in culinary arts.  A few years later, once I graduated and got my associate's degree.  I decided I wanted to transfer to Illinois Institute of Technology to study IT management and cyber security and computer forensics.  I am super glad that I made the decision to transfer!</p>
	<p>I am currently working towards joining the co-terminal program so that I may get my bachelor's in ITM and my master's in cyber security and computer forensics.</p>
	<p>I am so excited to work with everyone in this course.  I have no prior experience in web development, but I am excited to learn more about the subject.</p>
